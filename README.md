fireworks.py is virtually a carbon copy of [tuftii's](https://github.com/tuftii/Sense-Hat-Examples/commits?author=tuftii) Fireworks on SenseHat script which can be found [here](https://github.com/tuftii/Sense-Hat-Examples/blob/master/fireworks.py). It has some minor tweaks to allow it to work on the UnicornHat HD. Still has some minor bugs to work out.
